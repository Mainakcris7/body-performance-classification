# Classification based on Body Performance

Classifying humans based on their fitness level and body performance. `A` class refers to the best body performance. This is a practice project based on `Classification` in `Machine Learning`.
Dataset is available on `Kaggle`.

## FAQ

#### Why you haven't used SVM?

Support Vector Machines are good for smaller dataset due to heavy calculations. I avoided using it because the dataset is quite large (shape : (13392,12)).

#### Why you haven't used Hyperparameter Tuning?

I tried to use GridSearchCV and RandomizedSeachCV both. But due to large dataset and complex models(other than the Logistic Regression), it takes so much time (GridSearchCV). RandomizedSearchCV is not a better option as it chhoses the parameters randomly, which can produce worse result (in my case, it actuall occurs).

#### Which models are you using in this project?
Logistic Regression, XGBoost, CatBoost, GradientBoosting Classifier and RandomForest.
